Credentials

.. java:type:: public class Credentials

   Just a file out of source control that you can use to hide our API Key. In reality, we won't be using a static API Key (in theory, someone could reverse engineer this somehow), but we'll be using it for beta testing. Thus, make sure you don't add it to source control (Git) and push it onto the master branch.
